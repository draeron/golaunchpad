# golang library for Novation's Launchpad

This library is to be use to communicate and control with a 
[Novation Launchpad](https://novationmusic.com/en/launch). Since i only have
access to a single [Mini Mk3](https://novationmusic.com/en/launch/launchpad-mini) 
that is the only device supported but if i can

It use the [rtmidi](https://gitlab.com/gomidi/rtmididrv) driver, which require 
CGO/gcc to compile on windows but no external libraries to run. I assume the 
requirement are the same on other platform. 

Other than that, i've tried to limit external dependencies to a minimum. Examples 
contains basic setup and are use as integration tests.
